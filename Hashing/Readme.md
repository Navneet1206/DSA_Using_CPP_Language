## Introduction
A hash map (or hash table) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations based on the keys. Hash maps use a hash function to compute an index (hash code) into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Definition
A hash map is a collection of key-value pairs where:
- Each key is unique within the map.
- Each key is mapped to a specific value.

## Operations

### Insertion
- **Description:** Adds a key-value pair to the hash map.
- **Complexity:** O(1) on average (assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions).

### Lookup
- **Description:** Searches for a key and returns its associated value.
- **Complexity:** O(1) on average (assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions).

### Deletion
- **Description:** Removes a key-value pair from the hash map.
- **Complexity:** O(1) on average (assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions).

## Collision Handling
Hash maps handle collisions (cases where two keys map to the same bucket) using various techniques:
- **Separate Chaining:** Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
- **Open Addressing:** The hash map looks for the next available slot (probing) when a collision occurs.

## Advantages of Hash Maps
- **Fast Lookup:** Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions, lookups, and deletions.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for a wide range of applications due to efficient data retrieval based on keys.
- **Scalability:** Can accommodate a large number of key-value pairs with minimal performance degradation.

## Disadvantages of Hash Maps
- **Space Complexity:** Requires additional space proportional to the number of entries, especially with collision resolution mechanisms.
- **Hash Function Dependence:** Performance heavily relies on a good hash function to distribute keys evenly across buckets.
- **Complexity in Implementation:** Implementing collision handling strategies (like separate chaining or open addressing) can add complexity.

## Applications
- **Databases:** Used in database indexing for fast retrieval of records based on keys.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Utilized in caching systems to store frequently accessed data.
- **Symbol Tables:** Implemented in compilers and interpreters to store variable names and their associated values.

## Conclusion
Hash maps are efficient data structures for storing key-value pairs and provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations on average. Understanding their operations, collision handling techniques, advantages, disadvantages, and applications helps in utilizing hash maps effectively across various domains and applications.
