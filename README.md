## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the building blocks of computer science and programming. This repository aims to provide simple and easy-to-understand implementations of common data structures and algorithms using C++. Whether you are a student, a professional, or an enthusiast, this repository will be a valuable resource for you.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementations of various data structures
- Detailed explanations and comments in the code
- Example usage of each data structure and algorithm
- Structured and organized codebase
- Open for contributions and improvements

## Installation

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navneet1206/DSA_Using_CPP_Language.git
```
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for this purpose. To install GCC, follow the instructions for your operating system:

- Windows: Install GCC on Windows
- MacOS: GCC comes pre-installed with Xcode. You can install Xcode from the App Store.
- Linux: Use the package manager of your distribution to install GCC. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the necessary tools, you can navigate to the directory and compile any of the provided C++ files. For example, to compile and run the main.cpp file, use the following commands:

```bash
cd DSA_Using_CPP_Language
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
You can modify the source files or create new ones to explore different data structures and algorithms.
